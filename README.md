# openFRUE - A Distribution Based on Gentoo!

openFRUE is a general-purpose Linux Distribution based on Gentoo Linux. The goal of this project is to provide a stable, and functional system while providing the power of the Portage package manager. 

# Installation

Installation can be found in the how-to-install txt file, which is provided.

The installation is very similar to Gentoo's, but it contains a more dumbed-down and easier to read guide.

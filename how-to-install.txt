					openFRUE 22.05 Installation Guide

	This is a quick install guide on how to setup a minimal openFRUE system. The package manager of
openFRUE has been chosen, by me, to be Portage as it allows easy configuration.

					Chapter 1: About the Install

	openFRUE is a Linux Distribution based on Gentoo Linux, offering a stable and secure system.
The installation of openFRUE shouldn't take very long, we recommend using exactly the instructions here.

					Chapter 2: Selecting a Medium

	Installing openFRUE can be done from any Linux Live-CD, making the installation very flexible. When
choosing a medium, we recommend using something like an Ubuntu Live-CD, but you can use whatever one you
like.

					Chapter 3: Partitioning

	Partitioning is a very important step in the installation process. you will need to make a GPT labeled 
disk partition to install openFRUE on.

	Assuming that you are using a Live-CD with a GUI (Graphical User Interface), you can use GParted to 
create/remove partitions and format them as you wish.

					Chapter 4: Selecting a Stage3

	As of now, openFRUE only offers Stage3 tarballs so if you need a full system and you do not have a network connection, we reccomend using one of the future-available Stage4 tarballs. (These will be minimal, with no 
Desktop Environment and a preinstalled Gentoo-dist kernel, along with the GRUB2 Bootloader.)

	Once you have selected your Stage3 tarball and have downloaded it, you will need to create a folder in the /mnt directory, make one now:

[root# mkdir -p /mnt/openfrue]

	Now that you have made the directory, extract your Stage3 to it:

[root# cd /mnt/openfrue]

[root /mnt/openfrue# tar xvpf openfrue-stage3.tar.xz --numeric-owner]

					Chapter 5: Installing

	Now that you have untar'ed the tarxz file, its time to select a mirror for Portage.

[root# mkdir -p /mnt/openfrue/etc/portage/repos.conf]

[root# cp /mnt/openfrue/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /mnt/openfrue/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf]

	Take a look inside the config with `cat`, or use a text editor to make sure everything looks good.

	One thing you should do before chrooting into the new environment is to copy DNS information. You can do
this by running:

[root# cp --derefrence /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/openfrue/etc/]

					Chapter 6: Chrooting

	Chrooting is a useful way to change environments, and to temporarily change the Linux root to a new
environment. However, to make sure everything works, we need to make certain filesystems.

[root# mount --types proc /proc /mnt/openfrue/proc]
[root# mount --rbind /sys /mnt/openfrue/sys]
[root# mount --make-rslave /mnt/openfrue/sys]
[root# mount --rbind /dev /mnt/openfrue/dev]
[root# mount --make-rslave /mnt/openfrue/dev]
[root# mount --bind /run /mnt/openfrue/run]
[root# mount --make-slave /mnt/openfrue/run]

	Now that we have made the filesystems, its now time to chroot into the new environment!

[root# chroot /mnt/openfrue /bin/bash]
[root# source /etc/profile]
[root# export PS1="(chroot) ${PS1}"]

Mount a boot partition (assuming you are using /dev/sda1 as your boot partition):

[root# mount /dev/sda1 /boot]

	At this point, you are now inside of the openFRUE environment, installation is not complete, however, 
but you have completed a good bit of it. 

					Chapter 7: Portage and Things

	Configuring Portage is pretty simple, that's why I wrote this guide for you. To install an ebuild
repository, just run:

[root# emerge-webrsync]

Or if you're behind a firewall or something blocks it:

[root# emerge --sync] 

Please note that it is best to not sync more than once a day.

	Assuming that you know how Portage works, and that you know how to use it, we will continue further steps.
Documentary on Portage can be found in the Gentoo Wiki.

If you cannot emerge linux-firmware, please add this to your /etc/portage/make.conf:

[ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"]

(Do note that this will allow you to install nonfree software.)

					Chapter 8: Timezones, and Everything Else

	Selecting the timezone for the system is an important part in the installation. To see available timezone:
[root# ls /usr/share/zoneinfo]

	Assuming that you are using OpenRC,

[root# echo "America/Chicago" > /etc/timezone] 

(replace "America/Chicago" with your timezone.)

[root# emerge --config sys-libs/timezone-data]

	Generate Locales, and edit them to your likings:

[root# nano -w /etc/locale.gen]

[root# locale-gen]

	Reload the environment:

[root# env-update && source /etc/profile && export PS1="(chroot) ${PS1}"

					Chapter 9: Installing, Configuring a Kernel

	For a quick, and easy/less painful install, we suggest using gentoo-dist kernel. However, you can use 
whatever kernel you want to by installing it with emerge.

Installing gentoo-dist:

[root# emerge -a sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-bin]

Now you should go ahead and clean up:

[root# emerge --depclean]

Now install linux-firmware. You'll need it :)

[root# emerge linux-firmware]

					Chapter 10: Configuring Your System

	Now is a good idea to make your fstab file. We'll save all the information about it. To edit it:

[root# nano -w /etc/fstab]

	You should edit the fstab to correctly fit your partitions.
If you need help finding out something about your partitions:

[root# blkid]

	Make a hostname, this is very important because by default the hostname is set to 'localhost', which some
software/firmware will not want to install if the hostname is set to this. 

[root# nano -w /etc/conf.d/hostname]

	Now you need to install network systems. A good detailed description of them can be found in the Gentoo
wiki. To install the ones we recommend:

[root# emerge -a net-misc/dhcpcd]

[root# rc-update add dhcpcd default && rc-service dhcpcd start]

[root# emerge -a netoworkmanager nm-tui nm-applet]

[root# rc-update add networkmanager default]

[root# emerge -a net-wireless/iw net-wireless/wpa_supplicant]

	You should set a root password now:

[root# passwd]

					Chapter 11: Installing Tools

System Loggers

[root# emerge -a app-admin/sysklogd]

[root# rc-update add sysklogd default]

					Chapter 12: Bootloaders

	The openFRUE developers recommend that you use GRUB2, because its the most popular. To install it:

[root# emerge -a sys-boot/grub]

Installing GRUB to your disk:

[root# grub-install /dev/sda]

(if needed, you can also add the "--force" and "--no-floppy" options.)

Configure GRUB:

[root# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg]

					End of Guide: Finalisation

	Now that you have a fully working openFRUE installation, you can finally reboot. Make sure that you remove the Live-CD or you will be booted again into the Live-CD instead of the new openFRUE system.

Some commands you will find useful:

[root# exit]

[cdimage ~# cd && umount -1 /mnt/openfrue/dev{/shm,/pts,} && umount -R /mnt/openfrue]
[cdimage ~# reboot]

There you have it! You now have openFRUE installed onto your system. Enjoy!
